The goal of `aquaman` R package is to calculate ecology metrics needed to assess
the mixing zone area, fulfilling these specific steps:

 - Assign bacteria taxa from DNA reads using `dada2` package.
 - Model IQI metric from assigned bacteria families.
 
This package is in an experimental phase. This package will provide inputs to
the `halia` package which then calculates the area of the mixing zone.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `aquaman` like so:

```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("aquaMetrics/aquaman")
```

## Model IQI

This example shows you how to calculate mixing zone from demo IQI input data:

```{r example}
library(aquaman)
```


Using assigned family-level bacteria taxa as predictors, calculate benthic
invert IQI as an outcome.

**WORK IN PROGRESS - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**

```{r}
# Run the IQI model based on demo taxanomic data
iqi_scores <- iqi(demo_taxa)
head(iqi_scores, 5)
```

IQI prediction model created by Tom Wilding (SAMS) based on training data from
SEPA And MOWI.

## Assign Taxa

**WORK IN PROGRESS - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**

Assign bacteria families based on S-16 DNA reads. This may in time provide the
input to `iqi()` function. Currently, a Qiime 2 command line script achieves
this part of the process.

*Note*, you will be prompted to download a reference taxonomic file on first
use. This will be stored locally.

```r
# Provide a path to the demo data within the package:
taxa <- assign_taxa(demo_path())
# ...this could take some time...
head(taxa, 5)
#>        sample_id                 Family reads
#> 1   MHS-ARD-0-E2           Mitochondria     8
#> 2   MHS-ARD-0-E2           Mitochondria    47
#> 3   MHS-ARD-0-E2           Mitochondria   384
#> 4   MHS-ARD-0-E2        Anaerolineaceae     7
#> 5   MHS-ARD-0-E2                   <NA>    10
```
